## Overview

This web was made with the pourpouse of practicing: scss, transitions, animations, object positioning and overall Js.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

I've noticed I can solve some things much faster than I did in previous projects. Positioning the buttons and the mobile menu was still a challenge, but now I know how to fix those kinds of problems. I'm happy with the result and my progress.
